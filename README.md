PDF-GPT represents a sophisticated platform seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence and document analysis, elevating the nuances of your PDF exploration. Upon uploading your document, a gateway to insightful conversations and revelations is unlocked. This innovative platform leverages the streamlit library, langchain, and the openai API to deliver a refined user experience.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a Python Virtual Environment**

   - On Windows
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate

   - On macOS/Linux
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. Install requirements
   ```bash

## lm studio chat

I also added a script that makes it possible to interact with any open source model (freely available from huggingface and supplied to lm studio). [check out this link](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/local-server)
The script is called `chat.py` and can be run with the following command:

```bash
python3 chat.py
```
